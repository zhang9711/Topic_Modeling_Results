# Topic_Modeling_Results 
This is the distribution of the topics per class from the BERTopic language model 
BERTopic was used to do topic modeling. One of the BERTopic functions was used: Topics per class. This was the generated distribution for the top 30 topics among six categories: post_user, family_members, friends_relatives, acquaintances, heard_relation, and no_patient (definition details were reported in our paper). These generated topics were based on Chinese, the order of the listed topics on the right side of this distribution was based on the topics' frequency among all datasets.
